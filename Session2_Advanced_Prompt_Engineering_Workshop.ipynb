      "🧠 AI Explains: SUPER COMPUTERS\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "Sure! Let’s dive into the fascinating world of supercomputers with an analogy that’s both fun and relatable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Imagine a Supercharged Brain! 🧠⚡**\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of your brain as a regular computer. It can solve problems, remember things, and even multitask, but it has its limits – like when you try to juggle too many tasks at once and your brain starts to feel like a traffic jam! 🚦\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, picture a supercomputer as a supercharged brain on steroids! It’s like having a team of thousands of tiny brains all working together, each one dedicated to solving a specific part of a gigantic puzzle. Let’s break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Speed**: If your brain processes information at the speed of a bicycle, a supercomputer is like a Formula 1 race car zooming at lightning speed! It can perform trillions of calculations per second. Imagine trying to solve a Rubik's Cube – while you might take a few minutes, a supercomputer could do it in a fraction of a second!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Parallel Processing**: Think of a group of friends trying to put together a massive jigsaw puzzle. One friend focuses on the edge pieces, another on the blue sky, and another on the green grass. Together, they finish the puzzle way faster than if just one person was doing it alone. Supercomputers work in the same way – they can tackle multiple tasks at the same time by breaking them into smaller chunks and processing them simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complex Problems**: Let’s say you’re trying to predict the weather for your weekend trip. Your brain can make a guess based on what you see out the window, but a supercomputer can crunch vast amounts of data, analyze patterns, and even simulate future weather conditions. It’s like having a crystal ball that’s supercharged with real-time data and scientific models!\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Applications**: Supercomputers aren’t just for fun and games; they’re used for serious stuff! Think about how they help scientists discover new medicines or how they simulate nuclear reactions to keep us safe. They can even model climate change to help save our planet. It’s like having a superhero sidekick for researchers and engineers, helping them solve the world’s biggest challenges!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the next time you hear about supercomputers, just remember: they’re like the ultimate brain team, turbocharged to tackle the most complex problems faster than you can say “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!” Whether it’s saving lives, predicting the future, or cracking the mysteries of the universe, supercomputers are at the forefront of innovation, making our world a better place – one calculation at a time! 🌍✨\n",

      "============================================================\n",
      "Sure! Let’s dive into the world of the sigmoid function, but first, let’s set the stage with a fun analogy!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Imagine a Roller Coaster! 🎢**\n",
      "\n",
      "Picture yourself at an amusement park, standing in line for a magnificent roller coaster. You’re filled with excitement and a hint of nervousness. As you buckle in, the ride starts to climb slowly, giving you a chance to enjoy the view. That initial ascent represents the first part of the sigmoid function, where the output is gradually increasing but still pretty low – just like your anticipation!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, once you reach the top, the ride suddenly plummets! Your adrenaline spikes, and you feel like you’re flying. In the sigmoid function, this corresponds to the steep middle section where the output shoots up rapidly. This is the thrilling part where everything changes, and you can’t help but scream in delight (or fright)!\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, as the roller coaster begins to slow down and level off, you glide back into the station, feeling a sense of calm. This represents the last part of the sigmoid function, where the output levels off again, approaching a maximum value but never quite reaching it—just like your excitement settling after the ride!\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, What Is the Sigmoid Function? 🤔**\n",
      "\n",
      "The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that has an S-shaped curve (hence the name sigmoid). It’s defined by the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[ S(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "where \\( e \\) is a mathematical constant (approximately 2.718). It takes any real number input (like the height of that roller coaster) and squashes it between 0 and 1, just like how your emotions are squashed into that thrill-seeking roller coaster experience!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why Is It Important? 🌟**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **In Machine Learning:** The sigmoid function is often used in logistic regression and neural networks because it helps model probabilities. Just like how your thrill level ranges from calm (0) to ecstatic (1), the sigmoid function helps predict outcomes that are binary (like yes/no or win/lose).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **In Biology:** The sigmoid function can model growth processes. For example, think of a population of rabbits. At first, they grow slowly (just like that first climb on the coaster), then rapidly multiply (the thrilling drop), and finally, they stabilize when resources become limited (the smooth return to the station).\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary: 🎉**\n",
      "\n",
      "The sigmoid function is like a roller coaster ride for numbers! It starts off slow, zooms up in excitement, and then levels out, capturing the thrill of change. Whether you’re predicting probabilities or modeling growth, this little mathematical gem helps us understand the ups and downs of life, much like our favorite amusement park rides!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, next time you hear about the sigmoid function, just think of that exhilarating roller coaster experience and the fun journey of numbers! 🎢✨\n",

      "\n",
      "Problem: Four people—Anna, Ben, Carla, and David—each live in a different colored house: red, blue, green, or yellow.  \n",
      "- Anna does not live in the red or blue house.  \n",
      "- The person in the green house owns a fish.  \n",
      "- Ben lives next to the person in the red house.  \n",
      "- Carla lives in the yellow house.  \n",
      "- David does not live next to Carla.  \n",
      "Who lives in each house, and who owns the fish?\n",
      "\n",
      "❌ WITHOUT Chain-of-Thought:\n",
      "To solve the problem, let's summarize the clues and deduce the information step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Anna does not live in the red or blue house.** This means Anna must live in the green or yellow house.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **The person in the green house owns a fish.** This indicates that whoever lives in the green house has a fish.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Ben lives next to the person in the red house.** This means Ben cannot live in the red house; he must be either to the left or right of the red house.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Carla lives in the yellow house.** This means Carla cannot live in the red, blue, or green houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **David does not live next to Carla.** Since Carla lives in the yellow house, David cannot live in either the house to the left or the right of the yellow house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's begin assigning the houses based on the deductions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Since Carla lives in the yellow house, Anna cannot live there. Therefore, Anna must be in the green house.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- Since Anna is in the green house, she owns the fish (from clue 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Now we know:\n",
      "    - Anna: Green house (fish)\n",
      "    - Carla: Yellow house\n",
      "\n",
      "- Since Ben lives next to the person in the red house (clue 3), and Anna is in green and Carla is in yellow, Ben must be in the blue house. Therefore, the only house left for David is the red house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together:\n",
      "- Anna lives in the green house and owns the fish.\n",
      "- Ben lives in the blue house.\n",
      "- Carla lives in the yellow house.\n",
      "- David lives in the red house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final assignments:\n",
      "- Anna: Green house (fish)\n",
      "- Ben: Blue house\n",
      "- Carla: Yellow house\n",
      "- David: Red house\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Anna lives in the green house and owns the fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ WITH Chain-of-Thought:\n",
      "To solve this problem, let's follow the steps outlined:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Identify what we know\n",
      "1. **Anna** does not live in the **red** or **blue** house.\n",
      "2. The person in the **green** house owns a **fish**.\n",
      "3. **Ben** lives next to the person in the **red** house.\n",
      "4. **Carla** lives in the **yellow** house.\n",
      "5. **David** does not live next to **Carla**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Divide it into smaller manageable components\n",
      "- We have four colors: **red**, **blue**, **green**, **yellow**.\n",
      "- We have four people: **Anna**, **Ben**, **Carla**, and **David**.\n",
      "- We need to determine which person lives in which colored house and who owns the fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Determine what we need to find\n",
      "We need to assign each person to a colored house and identify who owns the fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Choose the right approach\n",
      "We'll use a process of elimination based on the clues provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Solve step by step\n",
      "1. **From clue 4**, we know:\n",
      "   - **Carla** lives in the **yellow** house.\n",
      "   - This means the remaining houses for Anna, Ben, and David are **red**, **blue**, and **green**.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **From clue 1**, since Anna does not live in the **red** or **blue** house:\n",
      "   - Anna must live in the **green** house.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **From clue 2**, the person in the **green** house owns a **fish**:\n",
      "   - Therefore, Anna owns the **fish**.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. At this point, we have:\n",
      "   - Anna: Green house (with fish)\n",
      "   - Carla: Yellow house\n",
      "   - Remaining houses: Red and Blue for Ben and David.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **From clue 3**, Ben lives next to the person in the **red** house:\n",
      "   - Since Anna is in the green house and Carla is in the yellow house, Ben must live in the **blue** house. This means David must live in the **red** house.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Now we summarize:\n",
      "   - Anna: Green house (with fish)\n",
      "   - Ben: Blue house\n",
      "   - Carla: Yellow house\n",
      "   - David: Red house\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Assignment\n",
      "- **Anna** lives in the **green** house and owns the **fish**.\n",
      "- **Ben** lives in the **blue** house.\n",
      "- **Carla** lives in the **yellow** house.\n",
      "- **David** lives in the **red** house.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "- **Anna** - Green house (fish)\n",
      "- **Ben** - Blue house\n",
      "- **Carla** - Yellow house\n",
      "- **David** - Red house\n",

      "    and the stairs are too narrow. What do you do?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "🧠 AI's Creative Solution\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "Let's work through this systematically:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Core Challenge:**  \n",
      "Moving a piano to the 10th floor without a working elevator and with narrow stairs that can't accommodate the piano directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Available Resources and Constraints:**  \n",
      "- Resources: The piano, the building's staircase, possibly tools (e.g., dollies, straps), and personnel (helpers).  \n",
      "- Constraints: Narrow stairs, the size and weight of the piano, limited access points, safety considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Brainstorm Creative Solutions:**  \n",
      "- **Disassemble the Piano:** If possible, take the piano apart into smaller sections or components (e.g., removing the legs or keyboard) to make it easier to carry.  \n",
      "- **Use Alternative Lifting Devices:** Employ specialized equipment like a furniture lift, scaffoldings, or temporary ramps.  \n",
      "- **Build a Custom Railing or Track System:** Create a temporary inclined plane or track along the staircase to slide the piano up.  \n",
      "- **Use a Pulley System:** Install a pulley or block-and-tackle system from the top floor or window to hoist the piano up.  \n",
      "- **Leverage External Access:** If the building has balconies or external windows, consider bringing the piano in through an open window using a crane or pulley.  \n",
      "- **Create a Sled or Rolling Platform:** Place the piano on a sturdy, wheeled platform or sled, then slide it carefully up the stairs with multiple helpers.  \n",
      "- **Coordinate with a Professional Moving Service:** They may have specialized equipment or techniques for tight spaces and heavy items.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Evaluate Feasibility:**  \n",
      "- Disassembling the piano is often the safest and most practical first step; many pianos can be taken apart into manageable parts.  \n",
      "- Using a pulley system or external access might be viable if the building allows it and safety measures are in place.  \n",
      "- Building a ramp or sliding track requires time and stability but could be effective if space permits.  \n",
      "- External lifting via crane or window access involves permits and safety considerations but can be the most efficient for very heavy or bulky pianos.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Recommended Approach with Reasoning:**  \n",
      "**Disassemble the piano into smaller parts, then carefully carry or slide each piece up the stairs with multiple helpers.**  \n",
      "- This minimizes the risk and physical strain.  \n",
      "- It adapts to narrow stairs since smaller parts are easier to maneuver.  \n",
      "- Once all parts are on the 10th floor, reassemble the piano carefully.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional step:**  \n",
      "If disassembly isn't sufficient or feasible, consider **installing a temporary pulley system from the top floor or window** to hoist the heaviest parts, combined with disassembly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**  \n",
      "Start by disassembling the piano into manageable sections, then use multiple helpers to carry or slide the parts up the narrow stairs. If needed, supplement this with a pulley system or external access methods. This approach balances safety, practicality, and creativity to solve the core challenge effectively.\n",

      "Question: Explain sigmoid function\n",
      "\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "🎓 Data Scientist Response\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that maps any real-valued number into the range (0, 1). It is defined by the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "where \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm, and \\( x \\) is the input to the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Properties of the Sigmoid Function:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Range**: The output of the sigmoid function is always between 0 and 1, making it particularly useful for models that predict probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **S-shape**: The graph of the sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve, asymptotic to the lines \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\). This characteristic allows it to smoothly transition between these two extremes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Derivative**: The derivative of the sigmoid function can be expressed in terms of the function itself:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   f'(x) = f(x)(1 - f(x))\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "   This property is useful in optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, as it simplifies the computation of gradients.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monotonicity**: The sigmoid function is monotonically increasing, meaning that as \\( x \\) increases, \\( f(x) \\) also increases. This property is essential for its role in classification tasks, as it ensures a consistent interpretation of the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Applications:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Logistic Regression**: In logistic regression, the sigmoid function is used to model the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. The output of the sigmoid function represents the probability, which can then be thresholded to make a classification decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Neural Networks**: The sigmoid function has historically been used as an activation function in neural networks, allowing neurons to output values between 0 and 1. However, it has largely been supplanted by other activation functions, such as ReLU, due to issues like vanishing gradients.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Models**: The sigmoid function can also model growth processes, such as population growth and the spread of diseases, where the growth accelerates and then slows down as it approaches a carrying capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Limitations:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its utility, the sigmoid function has some limitations. Notably, it can lead to vanishing gradient problems during training of deep networks, where gradients become very small, rendering weights unresponsive to updates. Additionally, it outputs values that are not centered around zero, which can hinder convergence in optimization algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the sigmoid function is a fundamental mathematical construct that serves as a critical tool in various domains of data science, particularly in binary classification problems. Its properties and applications make it a staple in both statistical modeling and machine learning.\n",

      "🎓 Business Strategist Response\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that has significant applications in various fields, particularly in statistics, machine learning, and business analytics. It is defined by the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[ S(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "- \\( S(x) \\) is the output of the sigmoid function.\n",
      "- \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm.\n",
      "- \\( x \\) is the input value.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Characteristics of the Sigmoid Function:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Output Range**: The function outputs values between 0 and 1, making it particularly useful for models that need to predict probabilities. For example, if you are assessing customer churn risk, a sigmoid output can help estimate the likelihood of a customer leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **S-shaped Curve**: The graph of the sigmoid function resembles an \"S\" shape. As \\( x \\) approaches negative infinity, the function approaches 0, and as \\( x \\) approaches positive infinity, it approaches 1. This characteristic allows the sigmoid to model scenarios where there are thresholds or limits to growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Gradient**: The function has a steeper gradient around the center (0) and flattens out as it approaches the asymptotes (0 and 1). This property can be leveraged in optimization problems, as it allows for effective backpropagation in neural networks by providing a gradient that can be used to update weights.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Applications in Business Strategy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Segmentation**: The sigmoid function can help in classifying customers based on their likelihood to respond to marketing initiatives. By modeling customer data with a sigmoid function, businesses can identify high-potential segments for targeted campaigns.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sales Forecasting**: In sales models, the sigmoid function can be used to predict conversion rates based on various input metrics (e.g., lead quality, engagement levels), enabling companies to allocate resources effectively for maximum ROI.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Risk Assessment**: In financial modeling, the sigmoid function can help assess the probability of default or other risk metrics, allowing businesses to make informed decisions regarding credit and investment strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Actionable Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Utilize Sigmoid Functions in Predictive Models**: Incorporate the sigmoid function in your predictive analytics toolkit to enhance the accuracy of models relating to customer behavior and market trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Optimize Marketing Strategies**: Use the insights gained from sigmoid-based models to tailor your marketing strategies, ensuring that you focus efforts on high-probability customers for better conversion rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Regularly assess the effectiveness of the models using the sigmoid function and adjust parameters based on real-world outcomes to improve predictive accuracy over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "By leveraging the properties of the sigmoid function within your business strategy, you can derive actionable insights that drive growth, improve customer engagement, and ultimately enhance your bottom line.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **S-Shape**: The curve starts near 0 when \\( x \\) is very negative, rises steeply around \\( x = 0 \\), and asymptotically approaches 1 as \\( x \\) becomes very positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Gradient**: The slope of the sigmoid function is steepest at \\( x = 0 \\). This means small changes in \\( x \\) around this point can lead to significant changes in the output, which is useful in optimization processes.\n",

      "### Step 4: Synthesize the Solution\n",
      "- **Trend Summary**: The sales numbers show an initial strong growth, followed by a small decline, and then a robust recovery with consistent growth in the final two periods. \n",
      "- **Interpretation**: Overall, the trend appears to be positive despite a minor dip. The sales figures indicate a generally upward trajectory, suggesting that the business is likely on a growth path, and any setbacks may be short-lived.\n",
      "- **Recommendation**: It may be beneficial to investigate the reasons behind the dip from 150 to 140 to ensure strategies are in place to maintain growth and address potential issues that caused the decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Visualization (Optional)\n",
      "If this were a visual analysis, a line graph depicting the sales numbers over time would clearly demonstrate the upward trend with the small dip, making it easier to communicate insights visually.\n",

      "   Task Type: technical | Complexity: medium\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 Response:\n",
      "Certainly! A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style used for designing networked applications. It leverages standard HTTP protocols to enable communication between a client and a server. Here’s a structured explanation of how a REST API works, covering key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Core Principles of REST**\n",
      "   - **Statelessness**: Each API request from the client to the server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request. The server does not store any client context between requests, making each interaction independent.\n",
      "   - **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. This separation allows for the development of client and server components independently.\n",
      "   - **Uniform Interface**: REST APIs use a uniform set of conventions for interacting with resources, which simplifies and decouples the architecture. This includes standardized methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and resource URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).\n",
      "   - **Resource-Based**: REST APIs focus on resources (data entities) that are identified by URIs. Clients interact with these resources using standard HTTP methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **HTTP Methods and Their Usage**\n",
      "   - **GET**: Retrieve data from the server. It is safe and idempotent, meaning it can be called multiple times without changing the resource's state.\n",
      "   - **POST**: Create a new resource on the server. It is not idempotent as it can result in different states with each call.\n",
      "   - **PUT**: Update an existing resource or create it if it does not exist. It is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests will result in the same state.\n",
      "   - **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server. It is idempotent as repeated calls will not further affect the state after the resource is deleted.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Resource Representation**\n",
      "   - Resources can be represented in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. JSON is the most commonly used format due to its lightweight nature and ease of use with JavaScript.\n",
      "   - The server responds to client requests with a representation of the resource, usually including metadata (like HTTP status codes) and the resource's current state.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Stateless Communication**\n",
      "   - Each request must include all necessary context (e.g., authentication tokens, request parameters). This ensures that servers do not need to maintain session information, allowing for easier scalability and reliability.\n",
      "   - The use of tokens (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens) is common for managing authentication and authorization in stateless interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **HTTP Status Codes**\n",
      "   - REST APIs utilize standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of an API call:\n",
      "     - **200 OK**: Successful GET or PUT request.\n",
      "     - **201 Created**: Successful POST request that creates a resource.\n",
      "     - **204 No Content**: Successful DELETE request.\n",
      "     - **400 Bad Request**: Client error, often due to invalid input.\n",

      "### 6. **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**\n",
      "   - A constraint of REST that allows clients to interact with the application entirely through hypermedia links provided dynamically by the server. Clients can discover actions they can perform on resources by navigating links in the responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Versioning**\n",
      "   - REST APIs may need to evolve over time. Versioning can be implemented in various ways, such as through URL paths (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`) or HTTP headers, to ensure backward compatibility with existing clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "In summary, a REST API is a powerful and widely adopted method for enabling communication between clients and servers over the web. By adhering to its principles and utilizing standard HTTP methods, REST APIs promote scalability, simplicity, and a clear separation of concerns in software architectures.\n",

    "    def __init__(self, llm, tools, memory):\n",
    "        self.llm = llm\n",
    "        self.tools = tools\n",
    "        self.memory = memory\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def process(self, input):\n",
    "        # Standard processing pipeline\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Prompt Versioning\n",
